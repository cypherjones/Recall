# Memory Game - Recall

### AJ's Memory Game 
We were tasked to build a classic memory game using javascript and naturally our coding skills with HTML, CSS and the like. Here is a little taste at the end result --> [game example](https://github.com/cypherjones/Recall/blob/master/img/example001.png).

### Prerequisites and Installing
There isn't anything you really need to run and play this game. Just make sure you have ``` javascript``` enabled on your browser. If you do, you should be good to go. 

Likewise, there is nothing to install. Just follow the prompts and enjoy.

#### Built With
I used several pretty cool tools to build this game along with the instructions from the guys and gals over at Udacity. 

* [font awesome](http://fontawesome.io) - for some great icons
* [Sweet Alert](http://sweetalert2.com) - for the prompts and notifications

These tools allowed me to develop the game pretty quickly.
