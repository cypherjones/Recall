# Memory Game

## A js Memory Game
This is going to be a huge challenge for an old duck like me. So here goes. 

### Challenges
I had a ton of challenges for a first time Frontend guy. I'll try to go through them here in relative detail.

#### Shuffle, really?
I literally had no idea how to shuffle anything programatically starting out. And to be honest, I'm not entirely sure how this code works. But I did my research and found something that most people seemed to use when trying shuffle any sort of array. So thanks to Stackoverflow [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6274339/how-can-i-shuffle-an-array]
